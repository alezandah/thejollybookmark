== README, The Case of the Jolly Bookmark

This web app is about to be released live on the web, but the programmer made a few mistakes.

They are not aware of this.

The app allows a user to login and save bookmarks, as well as view bookmarks posted by others using the app.

Please help them fix the issues by testing the app manually, as well as writing some automated tests.

Check for the 5 things below.

Requirements to launch:

2. The index page requires you to be logged in.
